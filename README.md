# AES Playground

My experiments in understanding AES, Whitebox AES, and related attacks

My goals are to:

- Implement textbook AES from first principles.

- Implement LUT-based AES.

- Try extracting keys from the LUTs.

- Replicate academic Whitebox AES implementations.

- Implement known attacks, from first principles.

- Invent/implement novel attacks!
